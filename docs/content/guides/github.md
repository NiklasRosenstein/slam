# Using Slap in GitHub repositories

## GitHub Actions

Slap comes with a set of helpful GitHub actions that you can use in your workflows. These actions are available on
the [`NiklasRosenstein/slap`][0] repository. The templates generated by `slap init -t github` make use of these
actions to provide a good out-of-the-box experience.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/python.yaml"
@cat ../../../src/slap/templates/github-workflows/.github/workflows/python.yaml
```

```yaml title=".github/workflows/changelog.yaml"
@cat ../../../src/slap/templates/github-workflows/.github/workflows/changelog.yaml
```

These files demonstrate the usage of the GitHub actions.
