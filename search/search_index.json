Most CI systems allow you to securely store a secret as an environment variable. name: my-package # ... publish: pypi: credentials: username: __token__ password: '$PYPI_TOKEN' test_username: __token__ test_password: '$TESTPYPI_TOKEN' When you're ready to publish from the CI checks, make it run the following commands: - pip install slam - slam pkg update --verify-tag \"$CI_TAG\" - slam pkg publish warehouse:pypi It is also recommended that you add a trial-publish step. Note that we add the --allow-empty-tag to flag to allow that the value passed to --verify-tag can be empty. This is important because most commits won't be tagged during development. - pip install slam - slam pkg update --verify-tag \"$CI_TAG\" --allow-empty-tag - slam pkg publish warehouse:pypi --test","title":"Automate publishing in CI checls"},{"location":"guides/publishing/#publishing-snapshots","text":"The bump command can be used with the --snapshot option to update the version to one that indicates the Git commit distance since the last tagged version. This is useful to publish development snapshots. Note that PyPI/Warehouse does not actually (yet?) support snapshot version numbers. If you want to publish snapshots, you need an alternative package registry such as Artifactory). - slam pkg update --verify-tag \"$CI_TAG\" --allow-empty-tag - slam pkg bump --snapshot - slam pkg publish warehouse:pypi --test Important : Many CI systems may not fetch tags when cloning your repository. This means bump --snapshot can not figure out the commit distance and the generated snapshot version number will begin with 0.0.0 . If you encounter this issue, run git fetch --tags before Slam. If you do try to use snapshot versions with PyPI, you will see this type of error: HTTPError: 400 Bad Request from https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ '0.17.1+1.g986bed6' is an invalid value for Version.
