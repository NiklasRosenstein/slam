# Slam

Slam is a CLI that provides utilities for developing on Python projects. It works well with
[Poetry][] projects in particular, but you're not required to use it.

  [Poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/

### Installation

It is recommended to install Slam via Pipx, but you can also install it with Pip directly.

    $ pipx install slam-cli

> __Note__: Currently, Slam relies on an alpha version of `poetry-core` (`^1.1.0a6`). If you install it into
> the same environment as Poetry itself, you may also need to use an alpha version of Poetry (e.g. `1.2.0a2`).
